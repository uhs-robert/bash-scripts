# Setup Instructions

These scripts are designed for Linux to accomplish various tasks quickly. Many scripts can be used by any Linux distribution by some scripts like `sysup` are for Fedora specifically as that's my flavor of choice.

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to a folder that you will remember later on your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/uhs-robert/bash-scripts.git`

## Setting Permissions

After cloning the repository, you need to set executable permissions for the scripts. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd bash-scripts`
2. Run the following command to make each script file executable: `chmod +x *`
3. _(Optional)_ To save the permissions to your folder, run this command from the folder: `chmod -R +x /bash-scripts/scripts`
   > [!TIP]
   > This command ensures that you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts. Adjust the file path to point to where you placed the `/bash-scripts/scripts` folder.

# Bash Scripts

Each script comes with a -h or --help option to see how they work and how to use them.

> [!NOTE] > `bash_utilities` is the only exception. This script houses general functions for the other scripts to make maintenance easier for me.

## bash_utilities

This script provides various utility functions to enhance the functionality of other scripts. It includes functions for terminal color and text formatting as well as other terminal output functions.

## 2pdf

This script converts various document formats to PDF using LibreOffice. It's useful for preparing documents for sharing or printing. Supported formats include `.doc`, `.docx`, `.odt`, `.rtf`, `.txt`, and `.html`.

### Requirements

Make sure LibreOffice is installed on your system to use this script. You can install it using your package manager. If LibreOffice is not installed, the script will display an error message.

> [!NOTE]
> The script will place the converted PDF output in the same directory as the original file.

## add_font

This script downloads and installs a font from a specified URL, typically in a `.zip` format. Itâ€™s useful for quickly adding new fonts to your system without manually handling the installation process. The script automatically extracts the font files and updates the font cache so that the newly installed fonts are available for use immediately.

### Requirements

Ensure that `wget`, `unzip`, and `fc-cache` are installed on your system to use this script. These utilities are typically available on most Linux distributions by default or can be installed via your package manager. If any of these tools are missing, the script will fail to complete the installation process.

> [!NOTE]
> The script will place the downloaded and extracted font files in the `~/.local/share/fonts` directory and remove the downloaded `.zip` file after extraction.

## add2emu

This script moves all files from the current directory to a specified emulator folder. This script is intended for usage with Batocera and uses their folder structure but can be used with any emulator as long as you have the same folder/file organization.

You will need a folder setup as follows:

- Group all of your emulators in a single directory like: `emulators/ps2` and `emulators/gc` etc:
- Each folder should have a `roms` folder inside of it like `emulators/ps2/roms` etc:

With the setup above, make sure the `base_path` variable inside of the script matches the location of your `emulators` folder directory.

### Requirements

- **Dependencies**:
  - **pv**: This script requires the `pv` command-line utility for monitoring the progress of file transfers. It will be installed automatically if not found.
- **Permissions**: The script must be executed with sufficient permissions to move files and create directories in the specified paths.

### Options

- **`-h, --help`**: Displays the help message with usage instructions.
- **`<emulator_name>`**: The name of the emulator folder where files will be moved.
- **`[type]`**: The base folder type. Can be:
  - **`rom`** (default): Moves ROM files to the emulator folder.
  - **`music`**: Moves music files to the emulator folder.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The script assumes the directory is in `run/media/$username/SHARE`. This should be modified to match your directory for BATOCERA.

## clean_empty_dirs

## net_speed_test

This script installs `speedtest-cli` if it is not already installed, runs a network speed test, and logs the results for later review. It provides an easy way to monitor network performance over time.

### Features

- **Automatic installation**: Installs `speedtest-cli` if it is not present on the system.
- **Logging**: Saves the results of the network speed test to a log file for future reference.
- **Simple usage**: Run the script with minimal command-line options.

## org_files_by_date

This script organizes files in the current directory and its subdirectories into folders based on their creation date (or modification date if the creation date is not available). Files are either moved or copied into directories named by year and month.

### Features
